## Try It

Download and run [FxDockDemo.jar](https://github.com/andy-goryachev/FxDock/raw/master/dist/FxDockDemo.jar).
To avoid messing with the module paths and separate OpenJFX runtime, one can install
[JDK FX](https://www.azul.com/downloads/?package=jdk-fx#zulu)
from Azul.



## How to Use the Library

The library requires JDK 24+ with JavaFX 24+.

Please refer to [HOWTO.md](doc/HOWTO.md) for detailed instructions on how to use the FxDock docking framework in your project.
